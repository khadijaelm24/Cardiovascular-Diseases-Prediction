# Cardiovascular-Diseases-Prediction

## Summary

### Objective
The project aims to develop and evaluate several classification models to predict the risk of cardiovascular diseases using a dataset detailing individuals' health behaviors.
### Data Used
The data comes from a survey conducted by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, containing 308,854 rows and 19 columns, including demographic characteristics, medical history, and health behaviors (physical activity, alcohol consumption, dietary habits, etc.).

### Project Steps
1. **Data Understanding:**
   - Loading and exploring the data.
   - Descriptive analysis and visualization to identify correlations and trends.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Data cleaning: removal of duplicates and handling missing values.
   - Data transformation: normalization and conversion of categorical variables to numerical.

3. **Modeling:**
   - Creation of four classification models: k-NN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
   - Cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters for each model.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Use of metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to compare model performances.
   - Visualization of results using confusion matrices and ROC-AUC curves.

5. **Testing and Conclusions:**
   - Application of the best-performing model on a test set to evaluate its generalization capability.
   - Discussion of the results obtained and recommendations for clinical applications.

### Technologies Used
The project was implemented in Python, using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, with a development environment based on Jupyter Notebook.

### Impact
This prediction model aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk individuals, allowing for early interventions and better management of cardiovascular risks.
